Acceptance Tests As Monitors

* A simple library that allows you to run junit tests as monitoring checks.
* Runs tests on a schedule and exposes results via a restful api that can called from your monitoring (e.g. nagios, zabbix, icinga, pingdom etc etc)

## Latest Build Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/atam4j/atam4j.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atam4j/atam4j)

## Maven Dependency
    <dependency>    
       <groupId>me.atam</groupId>    
       <artifactId>atam4j</artifactId>    
       <version>0.3.0</version>    
    </dependency>

## Using atam4j

1. Include the atam4j maven dependency.

2. Write Junit based tests in the usual manner, with the exception of adding a `@Monitor` annotation to the class and including them in the main application classpath 
instead of the tests classpath. This can be done by including them in the `src/main/java directory` instead of the 
`src/test/java` directory.

3. Instantiate  `Atam4j` in the `run` method of your dropwizard application class.    

        new Atam4j.Atam4jBuilder()     
            .withTestClasses(new Class[]{HelloWorldTest.class})     
            .withEnvironment(environment)      
            .build()      
            .initialise();

4. Run the dropwizard app and observe the status of the acceptance tests reported under the health-check endpoint.
